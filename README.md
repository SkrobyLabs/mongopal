# MongoPal

A lightweight, cross-platform MongoDB GUI for exploring, viewing, and editing documents.

## Features

- Connect to MongoDB instances via connection URI
- Organize connections into nested folders with drag-and-drop
- Browse databases and collections in tree view
- View documents in Table or JSON format with pagination
- Smart column widths based on field names and types
- Edit documents with Monaco editor (syntax highlighting, formatting)
- Insert new documents with JSON validation
- Bulk operations with keyboard shortcuts (select, delete multiple)
- Collection schema analysis with field type distribution
- Export/import databases and collections with progress tracking and ETA
- Query filtering and sorting with mongosh script support
- SQL query mode with live mongosh preview and schema-aware autocomplete (SELECT/WHERE/ORDER BY/GROUP BY)
- AI query assistant: describe a query in plain words and generate it (mongo or SQL); schema-only prompts, Anthropic API key stored in the OS keyring
- Secure credential storage (OS keyring with encrypted fallback)
- Multi-tab interface with pinning, renaming, drag-reorder
- Full keyboard navigation throughout the app
- Notification history with actionable error hints
- Dark theme optimized for extended use (WCAG AA compliant)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24+
- **MongoDB Driver**: mongo-go-driver
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript 5.9+ (strict mode) + Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Desktop Framework**: Wails v2

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- Node.js 18 or later
- Wails CLI (`make install-wails`, pinned to Wails v2.11.0)

## Development

### Install dependencies

```bash
make install
```

### Run in development mode

```bash
make dev
```

This starts the app with hot reload enabled for both Go and React.

### Build for production

```bash
make build
```

The binary will be created in `build/bin/`.

### Build for specific platforms

```bash
# macOS amd64 and arm64 app bundles
make build-darwin

# Windows
make build-windows

# Linux
make build-linux
```

### Version metadata

MongoPal builds include runtime version metadata exposed through Wails via `GetVersionInfo`. Local builds use the exact git tag when the current commit is tagged, otherwise they report the current commit as a development build. Dirty working trees are marked as development builds.

## Releases

Pull requests run the reusable GitHub Actions build workflow automatically, and maintainers can trigger it manually from the Actions tab. The workflow runs unit tests, TypeScript typecheck, `go vet`, and frontend build before platform packaging.

To publish a release:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "MongoPal vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Pushing a `v*` tag runs the release workflow, builds platform artifacts, generates GitHub release notes, and publishes a release with:

- `MongoPal-linux-amd64.zip`
- `MongoPal-windows-amd64.zip`
- `MongoPal-macos-amd64.zip`
- `MongoPal-macos-arm64.zip`

Release builds patch `wails.json` product metadata from the tag version before packaging. macOS artifacts are currently unsigned and not notarized; users may need to allow the app in macOS Privacy & Security or remove the quarantine attribute manually.
